# Lab 3

Continuing where we left off from [andrew-chang-dewitt/cs_350-lab_02](https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt/cs_350-lab_02), this lab explores the basics of working with arrays.
It includes implementing operations that iterate over arrays, as well as mutating arrays.
Instead of assuming a constant-length array as in [andrew-chang-dewitt/cs_350-lab_02](https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt/cs_350-lab_02), this lab works with variable-length arrays, requiring some more math when managing loops & array pointers.
Finally, in my implementation of this lab, I began to practice few extra concepts: functions (conforming to RISC-V calling conventions), custom macros, & multi-file assembling & linking using [rarsm/rars](https://github.com/rarsm/rars).
